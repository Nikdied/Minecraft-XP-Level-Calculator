# Minecraft XP-Level Calculator

With this Programm you can calculate the number of experience that you need to get to a specific level as well as the level you would reach with a certain amount of xp.

## Usage
I compiled the program with gcc but every c-compiler should work.
To change between XP and level mode, just remove the "//" at the start of line five and replace the value with the level you want.
If you remove the "//" in line seven the program shows only the final output and the program is way faster.
